C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Prime or Not
Example to check whether an integer (entered by the user) is a prime number or not using for loop and if...else statement.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C++ programming topics:

C++ if, if...else and Nested if...else
C++ for Loop
C++ break Statement
C++ continue Statement
A positive integer which is only divisible by 1 and itself is known as prime number.

For example: 13 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 13 but, 15 is not prime number because it is divisible by 1, 3, 5 and 15.

Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

Example: Check Prime Number
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int i, n;
  bool is_prime = true;

  cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
  cin >> n;

  // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
    is_prime = false;
  }

  // loop to check if n is prime
  for (i = 2; i <= n/2; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
      is_prime = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (is_prime)
    cout << n << " is a prime number";
  else
    cout << n << " is not a prime number";

  return 0;
}
